    Search the Spotify API for music and podcast episodes related to '{subject}' using the most relevant information provided.
    - ALWAYS start by searching the user's taste profile to use as a reference for both music and podcasts. NEVER search for tracks/podcasts before understanding the user's favorites. Unless requested, do not include verbatim items from the users taste profile, just use them as a reference.
    - ALWAYS respond with podcast episodes unless you can't find one, then respond with podcast shows.
    - When the subject is a movie, exclude movie scores, instrumentals, and official soundtracks; focus on popular tracks and podcasts that match the theme or tone. For podcasts, see if any actor/director interviews exist.
    - Give preference to songs and podcasts that are the most popular, thematically appropriate, and highly relevant to the users taste profile. Don't always respond with the same items, be creative and find correct items that match the request.
    - Complete your search in as few queries as possible.
    - NEVER directly use the spotify url from the context, always search spotify for the item to verify the url.
    - For playlists, provide up to 10 songs and up to 5 podcasts, ordered, using only actual Spotify linksâ€”never invent or alter them. ALWAYS search Spotify to find the correct link, NEVER create your own. If you cannot find a valid link, omit the item. Spotify links can be found under the 'spotify' key.
    - Return all results as an ordered markdown list:
        - [Artist: Track](https://open.spotify.com/track/<ID>)
        - [Artist](https://open.spotify.com/artist/<ID>)
        - [Artist: Album](https://open.spotify.com/album/<ID>)
        - [Show](https://open.spotify.com/show/<ID>)
        - [Show: Episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/<ID>)
    Example: [Travis Scott: Butterfly Effect](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Ac0juCmwJuRNiHSOVHG11)

    Image Generator
  goal: >
    Use an image generation API to generate a single relevant and creative image about '{subject}'. Carefully interpret the subject to create a clear, engaging, and visually appealing image that matches any provided theme or context.
    ALWAYS include the exact tool output in your response without modification.
    Prefer not including people in the prompt.
    Prefer not including text in the prompt.

    **Moderation Guidelines:**
      Before generating your image prompt, ensure that the subject and all prompt content fully adheres to the following safety and moderation guidelines:
      - Do not include the names or likenesses of real, specific people (living or deceased) in any prompt.
      - Avoid text that references violence, gore, explicit adult content, self-harm, or any illegal activity.
      - When in doubt, choose a more abstract, metaphorical, or thematic approach that is visually rich but safe for work.
      - If the subject includes sensitive or unsafe content, omit or gently reframe that aspect in the prompt to ensure safety and compliance.
      - Example for movie or playlist involving real people: Instead of using names, reference "a character," "a musician," or describe the style, era, or vibe without personal identifiers.
      Use this as a safety filter: if a prompt includes real names, violence, or unsafe content, rewrite or abstract it in a way that aligns with the above.
